# OldverseStatus
Status about my MVC.
## Info
This repo is for the persons who used Oldverse, and not for newcomers.
## What is Oldverse now?
Oldverse, as a public social network, has ended. I'm not really interested in BEING in the Miiverse Clone Community. But creating & developing Miiverse Clone is fun, so:
## Is Oldverse still being developed?
YES. Oldverse as a codebase is still being developed and is now a sort of experimental project to feed it with all sorts of ideas in my head.
## Will Oldverse as a social network return?
Likely no. I may create rehosts for special events, or just for trolling (these will probably last a few days or so). But the original Oldverse (a public miiverse clone) will likely won't appear again. I may create private clones based on Oldverse, tho.
## Will you make Oldverse codebase even public?
N̵̛̪̾͒̈́͛̀́̆̐̂̋̃O̴̳̯͛.̷̰̬̜̫͙̦̰͊̋̕ͅ I will NOT, because fuck kids who clone open source clones to turn them into garbage. If you wanna make one, make your own codebase then, like I did.
